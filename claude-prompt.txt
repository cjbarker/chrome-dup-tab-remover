Create a chrome extension that will identify all open tabs that are duplicates providing the user the option to close all duplicate tabs leaving only one unique tab for the duplicate identified URL remaining open.  The extension should provide user ability with button to trigger the duplicate tab analysis. Once the analysis completes a list all tabs identified as duplicates should be displayed in a group tree structure.  The user should be  allowed to select check-box of each grouping or select all for tabs to be closed if the user selects button "Close Tabs".  Upon submission all identified duplicate tabs selected by the user should be closed.
